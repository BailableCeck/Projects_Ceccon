Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Andrea Ceccon
=====================================================================================================================================

After seven years of delving into the intricacies of various programming languages, including the enigmatic world of Assembly, all in the pursuit of academic career, I find myself at the crossroads of coding and management. Fear not, dear reader, for I'm not here to showcase my coding prowess with the intent to flex, but rather to embark on a journey of inspiring ventures. In this repository, you'll witness the chronicles of my future projects. Brace yourself for a mix of languages, styles, and perhaps a lack of impeccably formatted code – blame it on my penchant for management over meticulous syntax. Consider this not just a testament to my coding escapades, but also an open invitation for you to explore the uncharted territories of technology and innovation. Let the coding adventures begin!

* 🌍  I'm based in Bassano del Grappa, Italy
